# Side Quest App

This is a single page task management app

This is a full stack procject that I made for myself

# Stack Used

This app uses the following:

React
Apollo
GraphQL
Express
Node
MongoDB

# Features

You can do the following in the app

## Create Tasks

As all task management apps you can make tasks, add a time to tell what time such task will start, when will it end, and if the task should reset at a certain point.

You can also add a tag to your task to organize your tasklist.

## Subtasks

You can make as many subtasks as you want and each subtask can have as many subtask as you want.

## Saved Tasks

You can save Tasks and Subtasks if you want to. For tasks, you can add another instance of it in your task list. For subtasks, you can select a task in your active task list to append it to.

## Performance and Issues

At the current state of the application, the tasks are updated in real time for every modification to the task that you do. The app utilizes Apollo Client's Cache system to make a smoother and snappier App experience.

At the minute, the app is not fully responsive and loading screens could use some improvements. I am planning on making a native version of it when I'm done being distracted by new projects.

## Todos for Future Updates

To fix responsiveness for mobile screens
To add proper loading screens
To add profile pictures
To add client to server subscription
To add shared tasks feature
